## How to use std::format

Sometimes you'll want to use the format function, but this only works in C++20 and later,   
so you'll need to make some configuration changes.   
      
If you installed gcc via the c/c++ extensions manual,    
you can use the format function by adding "--std=c++20" to the arg part of the task.json file.    
Otherwise, you can use it by adding "c++20" to the "cppStandard" part of c_cpp_properties.json.
